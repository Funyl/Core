###Moved React rendering to server side###
#####February 13th, 2017#####
#####Change By: Sam Haves#####
- React is able to render on the server side with the help of browserify, this allows for much much faster page loading as the client does not need ot generate any DOM.
- There are currently some bad practice placeholders in just to get it working.
- *Added* Browserify and literalify to dependencies. 

###Initial Environment###
#####February 12th, 2017#####
#####Change By: Sam Haves#####
- Okay so I sort of just setup a better environment, based off of this tutorial https://scotch.io/tutorials/setup-a-react-environment-using-webpack-and-babel
- I really like it, babel and webpack are cool and useful.
